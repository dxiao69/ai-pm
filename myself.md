## What is your role in EUS?

## What do you enjoy doing outside of work?
Outside of work, I’m a full-on tech adventurer. I love exploring new technologies, especially anything to do with machine learning. There’s nothing better than setting up new tools on my own machine — no rules, no limits, just pure, hands-on discovery.

Way back in 2015, I was already trying to teach Python how to read a giant list of MIDI files and compose music in different styles. (Basically trying to create AI music before it was cool — sorry, Suno and Udio, I was here first!) I eventually let that project go, but my passion for AI only grew.

Now, I’m all about generating pictures, videos, music, and of course, tons of writing. I’ve trained Llama2 and Qwen to write like Shakespeare — and honestly, they didn’t do too badly at the whole "thee" and "thou" thing!

This year, my playground expanded even more: experimenting with DeepSeek and Manus to see what wild things they can do, and having a blast using Codium and GitHub Copilot to help me write code faster (and sometimes better). It’s like having a tiny army of robot assistants — and honestly, it makes coding way more fun.

If it’s bleeding-edge, creative, and just a little bit chaotic, you’ll find me right there, tinkering away.
## If you were to pursue a different carrer, what would it be?
I'd just build whatever cool idea came to mind — AI plugins, creative tools, fun experiments — and share them with the world. No big companies, no meetings. Just me, my laptop, and an endless list of “what if we tried this…” projects.
## What is your proudest accomplishment?
My proudest achievement is being the first author on a U.S. patent for a system that helps companies plan and manage their tech inventory more efficiently. It came from solving a real problem — making sure hardware like laptops and devices were ready at different locations without wasting time or resources. It feels great to know that something I helped create is now officially patented and making a real impact.
## What activities is on the top of your bucket list?
At the top of my bucket list might be introducing new AI models to cooking — imagine having a smart algorithm as your sous-chef, guiding you through recipes or even suggesting unexpected flavor combos. It’s like blending tech with taste!
## What is one thing your EUS peers would not know about you?
One thing my working peers might not know about me is that I actually enjoy getting my hands dirty with hardware and tinkering with tech setups. Whether it’s building custom setups, configuring new devices, or experimenting with unique tools, I love the process of hands-on problem-solving. It’s like giving my brain a workout outside of code and systems.
